### Intro
As part of April 2016's [Global Drupal Training Day](https://www.drupal.org/global-training-days/2016#april), we are hosting a Drupal Developer training day on April 9th.

Participants in the training will go through the steps involved in running and developing a simple voting app from a fresh computer using the Docker Toolbox. This simple app will include:

- Some shiz



To get started on the tutorial, go to the [Tutorial](./tutorial.md)

### Before you Get Started

Before you start the tutorial, please make sure you do the following:

1. Make sure you have a **partner**. We will be pair programming today! Pair programming is a method of programming in which two people work together at one keyboard. One person, *"the driver"*, types at the keyboard. The other person, *"the observer" (or "navigator")* reviews each line of code as it is typed, checking for errors and thinking about the overall design. For more information, see: [What is pair programming?](http://www.wikihow.com/Pair-Program)
2. Once you have a partner, choose **one** computer to use for the training. It will make things easier to build off the code you're writing together. **<<< TODO: Can two people share the same stackstarter environment on two computers?**
3. Decide who will be *the driver* and who will be *the navigator* for the first chunk of work.
3. Make sure to talk! Talk a lot!!!
4. **Switch roles often â€” at least every half hour.**
5. Go to: [http://www.stackstarter.io/spin](http://www.stackstarter.io/spin) and enter the provided spin code for today.
6. Ok, now you can get started with the [tutorial](./tutorial)!
