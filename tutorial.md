# Drupal Developer Training Exercise!

## Goals
The goal of this exercise is to work out our understanding of Drupal 8 module development. This document contains a series of serveral sections. Each sections will bring us closer to our fully functioning module.

The goal of our module will be to build a tool that will allow us to configure notices which will be displayed only for certain roles. The module will take us through many of the core concepts of Drupal 8 module development. All code for this module will be available here (@todo add link)
